The Collaboration package contains classes that are used for modeling Collaborations.

A collaboration is a collection of `Participants` shown as `Pool`s, their interactions as shown by `Message Flows`,
and MAY include `Processes` within the `Pools` and/or `Choreographies` between the `Pools`.
A Choreography is an extended type of Collaboration. `Collaborations` are contained in `Definitions`.
